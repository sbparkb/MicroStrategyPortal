/*
  CSS Styles for Data Import web application for Platform.

  This scss file is used to define all the data import styles. It is then compiled into the
  corresponding minified css file that goes into production and downloaded at runtime.

  Note: Please do not change the corresponding css file as they will be overwritten by the compiled
  version of this file. Instead all data import style changes should be made in this scss file or the imported partials.
