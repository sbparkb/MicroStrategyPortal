<!--  
	Store Layout Selector AJAX Visualization.
	There are number of cases where customers would like to have the ability to highlight areas using image maps and make these areas 
	clickable by sending a selector action. For example, customers may want to take a store layout and do the following:
	  1. Enable a rollover on each region.
	  2. Send out a selector action when that region is clicked.
	The hot areas that are clickable are done using image maps and there are several tools out there that can accomplish that and the final output imported in to MicroStrategy.
	This sample provide detailed information on:
	  1. A sample rollover behavior.
	  2. Selector action when clicked.
	Customer can use this sample and extend it to their needs.
