		BaseModel is a generic data model.  A "data model" is essentially a
		collection of property-value pairs, each of which represents "data".
		The model is represented in the browser's memory by a javascript class
		instance.  The name of the class is specified as one of the model's
		property-value pairs.  The GUI typically allows users to see/edit
		the model's data by displaying a "view" for that data model 
		(see BaseView further below for more details).
