		TreeModel is a data model which contains a hierarchial tree of
		nodes.  Each tree node can contain any generic value Block.
		The top level of the tree is defined by a single "rootNode".
		The rootNode may have 0, 1, or many children nodes, which may
		also have any arbitrary number of children nodes.
		TreeModel is typically used to describe a tree of folders in metadata, 
		or a hierarchy of attributes and elements.
