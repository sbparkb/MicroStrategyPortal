<!--
    This Block contains a subtotal for metric.
    
    This block definition may be a little confused. Generally, a subtotal has two parts: 
    definition metric and implementation metric. In the Metric Editor scenario, only "Sum" and
    "Aggregation" may contain implementation metric. To make the JSON simple, for the specific two, 
    "did"/"t"/"st" inherits from "WebObjectInfo" represents the implementation metric, and "dm" is for the 
    definition metric. While for other subtotals, only "did"/"t"/"st" are used to represent the definition metric.
