80044a3a=The report is either a: OLAP cube report connected to SAP BI, Microsoft Analysis Services, or Hyperion Essbase or Query Builder report or Freeform SQL report. These types of reports cannot use dynamic sourcing.
80044a3b=Null template unit was found on the report. 
80044a3c=A report limit is present on the Intelligent Cube. Intelligent Cubes with report limits cannot be used for dynamic sourcing. 

80044a3d=Null attribute was found on the report
80044a3e=A custom group or consolidation is used on the report. Dynamic sourcing cannot be used for reports that include custom groups or consolidations.
80044a3f=The Intelligent Cube included metrics, but the metrics were later removed or no longer enable dynamic sourcing. This Intelligent Cube cannot be used for dynamic sourcing
80044a40=The Intelligent Cube includes objects that do not use outer joins and are not enabled for dynamic sourcing. This Intelligent Cube cannot be used for dynamic sourcing.  Intelligent Cubes of this type can be made available for dynamic sourcing by selecting the Allow dynamic sourcing even if outer join properties are not set option for an Intelligent Cube. Intelligent Cubes of this type can be made available for dynamic sourcing by selecting the Allow dynamic sourcing even if outer join properties are not set option for an Intelligent Cube
80044a41=The Intelligent Cube cannot be used for dynamic sourcing because of lookup table problems. Intelligent Cubes of this type can be made available for dynamic sourcing by performing one of the following actions: Selecting the "Allow dynamic sourcing even if outer join properties are not set" option for an Intelligent Cube. Selecting the Preserve lookup table elements joined to final pass result table based on template attributes without filter option for the Preserve all lookup table elements VLDB Property
80044a42=Metric limit is NULL or incorrectly defined
80044a43=Null metric or metric with GUID_NULL as DSSID found
80044a44=The report is of a type that cannot use dynamic sourcing, which includes: MDX cube report, Query Builder report, Freeform SQL report, Data marts and Incremental Refresh report.

80044a45=Dynamic sourcing is disabled for the project.
80044a46=Dynamic sourcing is disabled for the report.
80044a47=The report cannot use dynamic sourcing because it is connected to a specific Intelligent Cube, or the user is browsing the elements of an attribute from within the report.
80044a48=The Intelligent Cube cannot be used for dynamic sourcing because of lookup table problems. Intelligent Cubes of this type can be made available for dynamic sourcing by performing one of the following actions: Selecting the Allow dynamic sourcing even if outer join properties are not set option for an Intelligent Cube. Selecting the Preserve all final pass result elements option for the Preserve all final result pass elements VLDB Property.
80044a49=At least one report level metric is required on report to use dynamic sourcing
80044a4a=The report or Intelligent Cube includes an attribute that is defined as possibly containing null values, which disables dynamic sourcing for the report or Intelligent Cube
80044a4b=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an attribute form used in the report's filter qualifications is not available in the Intelligent Cube.
80044a4c=Joint child relationships and many-to-many relationships are not supported for dynamic sourcing.
80044a4d=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because the break by parameter for a metric on the Intelligent Cube is not included in the Intelligent Cube. The break by parameter determines when calculations such as running summations or moving averages restart their calculations. For example, a running sum of revenue uses a break by parameter of the Year attribute. Without the Year attribute on the Intelligent Cube, the metric cannot be calculated correctly and dynamic sourcing is disabled.
80044a4e=The report cannot connect to the Intelligent Cube using dynamic sourcing because a metric on the report is at a higher level than what is available on the Intelligent Cube. For example, a report requires metric data to be displayed at a yearly level, but the Intelligent Cube can only display metric data at the quarterly level. Dynamic sourcing is not used to connect the report to this Intelligent Cube.
80044a4f=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a metric uses a function that cannot use dynamic aggregation by default. This prevents the metric from being able to display data at the level defined for the Intelligent Cube
80044a50=An error occurred while reading the value of the VLDB setting for duplicated rows for Analytical Engine
80044a51=An error occurred while reading the value of the VLDB setting for Nullchekcing for Analytical Engine
80044a52=Error occurred while parsing a metric
80044a53=NULL metric was found on the report
80044a54=The Intelligent Cube cannot be used for dynamic sourcing because it includes a metric that does not use outer joins. Intelligent Cubes of this type can be made available for dynamic sourcing by either enabling outer joins on all metrics included in the Intelligent cube or by selecting the Allow dynamic sourcing even if outer join properties are not set option for an Intelligent Cube
80044a55=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an unsupported metric type is included in the report or Intelligent Cube.
80044a56=This Intelligent cube metric cannot be used for dynamic sourcing because it has a condition in its definition. If this metric is used in the report filter or report limit the entire Intelligent cube will not be available for dynamic sourcing

80044a57=This error commonly occurs because a compound metric is included in the Intelligent Cube, which is preventing the Intelligent Cube from being available for dynamic sourcing. Only compound metrics that are defined as smart metrics can be included in Intelligent Cubes.
80044a58=Unexpected metric type was found
80044a59=The Intelligent Cube cannot be used for dynamic sourcing because it includes a metric that cannot be aggregated, and the metric level in the report is different than the metric level in the Intelligent Cube.
80044a5a=The metric in an Intelligent Cube cannot be used for dynamic sourcing because it is a level metric. 

80044a5b=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a metric uses a fact with a fact extension or degradation
80044a5c=Problem with the SQL generation, we cannot find last comp unit
80044a5d=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because it cannot be determined which table was used to return a metric's values. This can be caused by the optimization of metrics by the MicroStrategy SQL Engine. For example, a metric named ExampleMetric is defined as Metric1 / Metric2, and Metric1 and Metric2 both have a condition to only return data for the Northeast region. Since both metrics include the same condition, this condition is applied once to the metric ExampleMetric rather than to Metric1 and Metric2 separately
80044a5e=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an attribute form is used in a conditional metric included on the report or the report filter, and the attribute form is not included in the Intelligent Cube.
80044a5f=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an attribute form used to define the level for a level metric is not included in the Intelligent Cube. This can also be caused by defining the filtering of a target for a level metric to be absolute or ignore.
80044a60=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a metric included in the Intelligent Cube uses zero checking, which is enabled with the Zero Check VLDB property. Using zero checking on metrics in Intelligent Cubes causes the Intelligent Cubes to be unavailable for dynamic sourcing.
80044a61=The current metric or a component metric contained in the current metric has been disabled for dynamic sourcing
80044a62=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because old OLAP Services behavior is enabled. To use the new OLAP Services behavior, select the Use OLAP\u2019s new behavior option for the OLAP New Behavior VLDB Property
80044a63=An overflow occurred while calculating the metric
80044a64=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because the fact entry level of a metric on the report and the filtering criteria of the report cannot be satisfied by the Intelligent Cube. For example, a report includes a metric that has a fact entry level of Year, and the filter includes a qualification on the Month attribute, which is at a lower logical level. If the lower level attribute used in the filter (for this example, Month) is not included in the Intelligent Cube, dynamic sourcing cannot be used. To support dynamic sourcing, the lower level attribute must be included in the Intelligent Cube
80044a65=Error reading the value for Distinguish Duplicated Rows or NullChecking in the Analytical Engine
80044a66=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because nested aggregation is used for a metric in an intelligent cube. Nested aggregation metrics in intelligent cubes are not supported for dynamic sourcing
80044a67=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a passthrough or database function such as ApplySimple is used in a metric's formula.
80044a68=This metric cannot be used for Dynamic Sourcing because it is either a non-smart metric or does not have a simple expression such as Aggregate_Function(Fact) (eg:- Sum(Sales)).
80044a69=An unspecified error occurred when parsing the filter
80044a6a=NULL node found in filter
80044a6b=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because two filter qualifications on different attributes or attribute elements are combined with the logical operator OR.
80044a6c=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because filter qualifications are combined with AND NOT or OR NOT logical operators.
80044a6d=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an unsupported filter type is used.
80044a6e=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an unsupported function is included in a filter
80044a6f=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an unsupported expression is included in a filter
80044a70=An unknown type error occurred when parsing the filter
80044a71=An unspecified error occurred when parsing the filter
80044a72=A report template attribute or attribute form is missing from the cube template
80044a73=We did not find an appropriate metric in the cube for the current report metric. Please refer to the extended mismatch log for a detailed comparison

80044a74=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a cross join is used for a metric.
80044a75=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because the break by parameter for a metric on a report is not included in the Intelligent Cube. The break by parameter determines when calculations such as running summations or moving averages restart their calculations. For example, a running sum of revenue uses a break by parameter of the Year attribute. Without the Year attribute on the Intelligent Cube, the metric cannot be calculated correctly and dynamic sourcing is disabled.
80044a76=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because the sort by parameter for a metric is not included in the Intelligent Cube. The sort by parameter determines the order in which calculations such as running summations or moving averages perform their calculations. For example, a running sum of revenue uses a sort by parameter of the Quarter attribute. Without the Quarter attribute on the Intelligent Cube, the metric cannot be calculated correctly and dynamic sourcing is disabled.
80044a77=Unspecified error occurred when trying to match cube and report
80044a78=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an attribute form present in the report is not available in the Intelligent Cube.
80044a79=If report has no metrics on it, it can only dynamically source from a cube with no metrics too.

80044a7a=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an attribute used to define the security filter of the user executing the report is not included in the Intelligent Cube.
80044a7b=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an attribute used to define the security filter of the user executing the report is not included in the Intelligent Cube.
80044a7c=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because the report and Intelligent Cube use different database instances
80044a7d=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used for the report because the report contains no metrics, and the Intelligent Cube does not use the same level as the report. For reports with no metrics, Intelligent Cubes must have the same level as these reports to use dynamic sourcing.
80044a7e=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because the Intelligent Cube uses MultiSource Option to connect to multiple data sources, but the user running the report is not licensed to use MultiSource Option.
80044a7f=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because the report uses metrics that are not at the report level. To support dynamic sourcing for these types of reports, Intelligent Cubes must support outer joins.
80044a80=The report cannot connect to the Intelligent Cube using dynamic sourcing because the Distinguish Duplicated Rows VLDB property is not defined the same in the report and the Intelligent Cube.
80044a81=The report cannot connect to the Intelligent Cube using dynamic sourcing because the options used for various VLDB properties do not match between these two objects.
80044a82=The report cannot connect to the Intelligent Cube using dynamic sourcing because the Intelligent Cube is not available for the locale of the user viewing the report. For MicroStrategy projects that support multiple languages and character sets, users can view reports that display data for their locale. To use dynamic sourcing, an Intelligent Cube must be available for the user's locale.
80044a83=Unspecified error occurred when trying to match cube and report metric
80044a84=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an attribute form used to define the level for a level metric is not included in the Intelligent Cube.
80044a85=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an attribute form is used in a conditional metric included on the report or in the report filter, and the attribute form is not included in the Intelligent Cube
80044a86=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an attribute form is used in a conditional metric included on the report or in the report filter, and the attribute form is not included in the Intelligent Cube
80044a87=Unspecified error occurred when trying to match cube metric and report metric
80044a88=The Intelligent Cube cannot be used for dynamic sourcing for the report because it cannot be verified that the Intelligent Cube filter on a particular metric is less restrictive than the report filter
80044a89=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a report is used as a filter of the report or Intelligent Cube.
80044a8a=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a metric qualification is used in the report or Intelligent Cube
80044a8b=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a relationship qualification or a report as a filter or a metric qualification or an absolute metric causing a subquery is used in the report or Intelligent Cube.
80044a8c=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a metric qualification is used in the report or Intelligent Cube.
80044a8d=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a metric qualification is used in the report or Intelligent Cube
80044a8e=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a relationship qualification is used in the report or Intelligent Cube.
80044a8f=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a fact is included in a filter. This can only occur if you use one of the SQL optimization options available with the SQL Global Optimization VLDB property.
80044a90=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because filtering qualifications could not be combined correctly with the logical operator OR. To support dynamic sourcing you can remove or modify filter qualifications
80044a91=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a passthrough or database function such as ApplySimple is used in the filter
80044a92=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an invalid filter qualification that uses the Between operator is used. The first value must be less than or equal to the second value
80044a93=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because the report uses a filter qualification that qualifies on the text data of an attribute form, and these types of qualifications have been disabled for dynamic sourcing
80044a94=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a filter qualification includes two incompatible data types. One scenario in which this can occur is when identity forms are used to filter data, and smaller identity numbers use an integer type, while larger identity numbers use big decimal
80044a95=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an element that is not supported for dynamic sourcing is included in the filter.
80044a96=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an unsupported condition is included in the filter
80044a97=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because the report uses a sort on the text data of an attribute form, and these types of sorts have been disabled for dynamic sourcing
80044a98=The Intelligent Cube cannot be used for dynamic sourcing for the report because it cannot be verified that the Intelligent Cube filter is less restrictive than the report filter.
80044a99=Expected DimMetricLeaf, found something else
80044a9a=NULL AggMetric was found.
80044a9b=Something else was found where AggMetricLeaf was expected
80044a9c=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a non-aggregation function such as First is used, and the metric level in the report is different than the metric level in the Intelligent Cube.
80044a9d=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because of one of the following scenarios: A metric retrieves its data from different aggregate tables for the report and Intelligent Cube. The metric uses an aggregation function other than Sum for the aggregate table. The metric uses the Sum aggregation function, but the aggregate table is disabled for dynamic sourcing. 

80044a9e=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because the Distinct parameter is used in the aggregation of a metric and the level of data does not match between the report and the Intelligent Cube. To support dynamic sourcing when a Distinct parameter is used in an aggregation, the Intelligent Cube and report must contain the exact same level of data
80044a9f=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because a metric that cannot be aggregated is used, and the metric level in the report is different than the metric level in the Intelligent Cube.
80044aa0=Something else was found where function was expected
80044aa1=Unspecified matching error occurred when comparing the cube metric and the report metric. 
80044aa2=Unspecified matching error occurred when comparing the cube metric and the report metric. 
80044aa3=Unspecified matching error occurred when comparing the cube metric and the report metric. 
80044aa4=Unspecified matching error occurred when comparing the cube metric and the report metric. 
80044aa5=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because the option selected for the Null checking for Analytical Engine VLDB Property is different for the report and Intelligent Cube. The same option must be used to match a report and Intelligent Cube for dynamic sourcing. 

80044aa6=This error signifies that, due to differing metric formulas, a metric in an Intelligent Cube is not a match for a metric on a report. All metrics on an Intelligent Cube are checked to determine if they are a match for a metric on a report. This process is done until a match is found, or no match is found and dynamic sourcing is not used (finding no matches for a metric returns the error CMI_NO_GOOD_CANDIDATE_METRICS_FOUND).
80044aa7=Dynamic Sourcing cannot be used because the report metric and cube metric use different transformations

80044aa8=Dynamic Sourcing cannot be used because the report requires aggregation of a cube metric on attributes related to transformation, which is currently not supported

80044aa9=Maximum number of result rows retrieved per report was exceeded.
80044aaa=Cube metric cannot be reused because the nonaggregation types for the cube and report metric are not the same. 
80044aab=Cube metric cannot be reused for this report because if a metric uses nonaggregation by relation report, cube metrics need to be exactly the same level. 
80044aac=The cube metric and the report metric have nonaggregation on different hierarchies
80044aad=Unsupported element was found inside of a nested aggregation metric
80044aae=The current report cannot use Dynamic Sourcing because there is a metric with a transformation on a nested aggregation metric
80044aaf=The report metric cannot reuse the current cube metric. To be able to reuse a metric for nonaggregation by fact, the cube group-by level must contain the attributes from the fact entry level that are related to the nonaggregation attributes; or the report metric group-by level must perform aggregation only in the nonaggregation dimension.
80044ab0=The current user needs to have the "Use Dynamic Sourcing" privilege to be able to use dynamic sourcing. 
80044ab1=There is a loop in user group hierarchy, this group is involved in the loop: 
80044ab2=The current cube cannot use the current cube for dynamic sourcing because the cube and the report have a different source table
80044ab3=Unexpected CompUnit Structure
80044ab4=For non-aggregation by lookup we need the cube to have all the attribute elements from their corresponding look up tables (set using the "Joins-> Preserve all look up table elements VLDB setting, option 3), when the report requires aggregation along the non-agg dimension with respect to the cube
80044ab5=We cannot use this cube metric because the fact entry level attribute that is related to the nonaggregation attribute of this metric is not on the cube and the cube and the report metric group by levels are different. 
80044ab6=Dynamic Sourcing cannot be used because there is an unsupported function in the current metric. 
80044ab7=There is a nonaggregation metric that is used multiple times in the report and it has different group by. This usually happens when used inside of nested aggregation metric at least once. 
80044ab8=Metrics that have nonaggregation on attributes related to the security filter bottom attributes level are not supported for Dynamic Sourcing
80044ab9=Cannot use dynamic sourcing for this report because of the value for the Non-agg metric optimization VLDB setting. To make this report available for dynamic sourcing make sure (1) All the metrics on the report are inner joined OR (2)All the metrics on the report are outer joined OR (3) The VLDB setting "Non-agg metric optimization" is set to "Optimized for smaller temp table" and the VLDB Setting "Compute Non-Agg before/after OLAP Functions (e.g. Rank) Calculated in Analytical Engine" is set to "Calculate non-aggregation before OLAP functions/Rank"
80044aba=Non-aggregation is not supported for dynamic sourcing in the outer metric of a nested aggregation
80044abb="Filtering = None" on a metric that is performing non-aggregation by lookup table is not supported for dynamic sourcing
80044abc=The deletion report filter is either empty, has a metric qualification, or contains objects not on the target Intelligent Cube
80044abd=Error executing incremental refresh report 
80044abe=The incremental refresh report cannot be a Freeform SQL report or Query Builder report when it is defined as insert or update by filter.
80044abf=The incremental refresh report and the published Intelligent Cube do not have the same set of attributes and/or metrics. Incremental data added to the Intelligent Cube will not succeed unless either the incremental refresh report is modified or the Intelligent Cube is modified and republished
80044ac0=The attributes on the incremental refresh report template can only be a subset of the attributes on the target Intelligent Cube. Incremental data deleted from the cube will not succeed unless either the incremental refresh report is modified or the Intelligent Cube is modified and republished
80044ac1=The incremental refresh report and the published Intelligent Cube either do not have the same set of attributes or at least one of the metrics on the incremental refresh report does not match metrics on the published Intelligent Cube. Incremental data updated for the Intelligent Cube will not succeed unless either the incremental refresh report is modified or the Intelligent Cube is modified and republished
80044ac2=The new Intelligent Cube definition and the published Intelligent Cube do not have the same attributes and/or metrics. The Intelligent Cube republish effort was not successful. The Intelligent Cube must be modified before it can be republished.
80044ac3=The attribute forms of the incremental refresh report or new Intelligent Cube definition are not consistent with the published Intelligent Cube. Operations on the cube will not succeed unless either the incremental refresh report is modified or the Intelligent Cube is modified
80044ac4=Cannot use dynamic sourcing for this report because of the value for the Nested Aggregation Outer Join VLDB setting. To make this report available for dynamic sourcing, make sure (1) There is no Nested Agg on the report OR (2) The VLDB setting "Nested Aggregation Outer Join" is set to "Do not perform outer join on nested aggregation" or "Do perform outer join on nested aggregation when all formulas have the same level"
80044ac5=Cannot use dynamic sourcing for this Intelligent Cube because of unsupported type of incremental refresh affecting the current Intelligent Cube data
80044ac7=The metric cannot use dynamic sourcing because null checking with an aggregation function other than sum and formula/metric outer join is not supported
80044ac8=The metric cannot use dynamic sourcing because it includes arithmetic operations on component metrics that have different group-by levels
80044ac9=Non-aggregation by lookup on an incrementally refreshed Intelligent Cube is not supported
80044aca=Dynamic sourcing cannot be used because an attribute form is used in a conditional metric included on the report or the report filter, and the attribute form is not included in the Intelligent Cube.
