### Global defaults ###
# Each cache defines a timeout and refresh time.
#
# Timeout governs when a cache entry expires. An expired
# entry will be removed from the cache. Timeout is calculated
# from the last access to that entry. Removal is performed
# by a background thread, while refresh is lazy, i.e. an
# expired entry is refreshed only when that entry is accessed. 


# values are in seconds
cleanupTime=1200
disableSoftRef=NO

# To change individual cache settings copy-paste lines below representing 
# values you want to change, uncomment them, replace CACHE_NAME with
# cache name and desired values.

### Server Caches ###
# These caches have entries that are tied to individual
# Intelligence Servers. Like the project level cache, the
# typical timeout and refresh time here is also 24 hours.

# Server preferences.
# Server preferences are applied to all projects for all users in
# a given Intelligence Server, unless overridden by project preferences
