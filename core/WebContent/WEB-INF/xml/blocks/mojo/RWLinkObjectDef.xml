	The definition of the Link-typed object. Currently TextFields and Images use the RWLinkObject Block. 
	It inherits the RWUnitDef, but has two additional components: 
	1. An inherited LinkInfo, meaning it contains Hyperlink information
	2. A "dl" property, which is used to generate the pop-up menu.
